\point{Artificial Intelligence}{
  \href{https://www.zerocracy.com}{Zerocracy} is an AI-empowered chatbot that
  helps project managers coordinate programmers, increasing the quality and decreasing costs.
  Its uniqueness lies in the pay-by-result management \href{https://www.xdsd.org}{model} we invented in 2009, which
  \highlight{revolutionized} and disrupted the market, leading the fast-growing trend of
  \href{http://papers.zold.io/freelance-deck.pdf}{freelancing}.
  Read more about our \href{http://papers.zold.io/zerocracy-deck.pdf}{mission},

  micropayments, invented and created by \href{https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html}{Yegor Bugayenko},
  the CEO and founder of Zerocracy. As its \href{http://papers.zold.io/green-paper.pdf}{Green Paper}
  explains, Zold is way faster than any other
  existing cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and much
  cheaper in maintenance. The \href{http://papers.zold.io/wp.pdf}{White Paper} fully discloses the details
  of the invented technology. \highlight{8\%} of Zold total capacity is
  owned by Zerocracy.}

\point{RPA Market}{
  According to the \href{http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/it-robotic-automation-market.html}{recent report}

  objective is IPO in 5-6 years with the valuation of \$4B, which means
  \highlight{250x} for first-round investors.}
